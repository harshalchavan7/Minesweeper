# Minesweeper
The well-known Minesweeper game is implemented in the console using the provided Java code.
Players uncover hints by revealing cells within a 8x8 matrix while avoiding mines.
Mine placement, hint computation, recursive cell disclosing, and a winning or losing mechanism are all included in the game.

# How to Play
Compile and run the Java program (Minesweeper.java) using a compatible Java compiler.
Follow the prompts to reveal cells by entering 'r' and the row and column coordinates.
Avoid hitting mines ('*') while strategically revealing cells to uncover hints.
The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed, or if a mine is hit.

# Code Overview
The game logic is implemented in Java.
The board array represents the game grid, and the revealed array tracks revealed cells.
Mines are randomly placed, and hints are calculated for each cell indicating nearby mines.
Recursive revealing is used for empty cells, expanding the reveal to adjacent cells.
The game checks for win or loss conditions, displaying appropriate messages.

# Future Enhancements
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more immersive experience.
Add different difficulty levels with larger grids and more mines.
Provide statistics and a leaderboard for tracking high scores.
Enhance the user interface with color-coding and better visual cues.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game or customize the experience.
